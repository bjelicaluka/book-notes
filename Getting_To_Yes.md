# *_Getting to Yes_*

## Separate People From the Problem

### Negotiators are people first
#### You are dealing with human beings

* Every negotiator has two kinds of interests: substance and relationship
* The relationship tends to become entangled with the problem
* Separate the relationship from the substance by dealing directly to the people problem
  
### Perception
#### Understand the other side's thinking
  
* Put yourself in their shoes
* Don't deduce their intentions from your fears
* Don't blame them for your problem
* Discuss each other's perceptions
* Look for opportunities to act inconsistently with their perceptions
* Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process
* Face-saving: Make your proposals consistent with their values
  
### Emotion 
#### Feelings may be more important than talk

* First recognize and understand emotions, theirs and yours
* Make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate
* Allow the other side to let off steam
* Don't react to emotional outbursts
* Use symbolic gestures
  
### Communication 
#### Without communication there is no negotiation

* Listen actively and acknowledge what is being said
* Speak to be understood
* Speak about yourself, not about them ("_I feel let down_" instead of "_You broke your word_")
* Speak for a purpose (sometimes the problem is not too little communication, but too much)
  
### Prevention works best 
#### The best time for handling people problems is before they become people problems
  
* Build a working relationship
* Face the problem not the people


## Focus on Interests, Not Positions
### For a wise solution reconcile interests, not positions

* Interests define the problem - the problem lies in the conflict between each side's needs, desires, concerns, and fears.
* Behind opposed positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.
  
### How do you identify interests?

* Ask "Why?" - basic technique to put yourself in their shoes
* Ask "Why not?" - Think about their choice.
* Realize that each side has multiple interests. - You have the interest in not only affecting, but also in effect an agreement.
* The most powerful interests are basic human needs. - security, economic well-being, a sense of belonging, recognition, control over one's life.
* Make a list. - it helps you remember the other side's interests and enables you to improve the quality of your assessment.

### Talking about interests

* Make your interests come alive. - one guideline is to be specific.
* Acknowledge their interests as part of the problem.
* Put the problem before your answer. - present your interests and reasoning first, and your conclusions or proposals later.
* Look forward, not back. - people are more likely to respond to what someone has said or done than to act in pursuit of their long-term interests.
* Be concrete but flexible. - know where you are going and yet be open to fresh ideas.
* Be hard on the problem, soft on the people. - this is the place to spend your aggressive energies; the problem.
  

## Invent Options for Mutual Gain

### Diagnosis
#### People believe that they know the right answer
  
* Premature Judgment - judgment hinders imagination
* Searching for the single answer - People tend to narrow the gap between positions, not broaden the options available.
* The assumption of a fixed pie - a negotiation often appears to be a "fixed-sum" game.
* Thinking that solving their problem is their problem
  
### Prescription
#### Invent creative options

* Separate inventing from deciding - since judgment hinders imagination, separate the creative act from the critical one. Invent first, decide later.
>*  Brainstorming - designed to produce as many ideas possible to solve the problem at hand

>*  Before brainstorming:
>		1. Define your purpose - think of the outcome of the session
>		2. Choose a few participants - not too few and not too many (5-8)
>		3. Change the environment
>		4. Design an informal atmosphere
>		5. Choose a facilitator

>*  During brainstorming:
>		1. Seat the participants side by side facing the problem.
>		2. Clarify the ground rules, including the no-criticism rule.
>		3. Brainstorm - come up with a long list of ideas.
>		4. Record the ideas in full view, reinforce a tangible sense of collective achievement.

>*  After brainstorming:
>		1. Star the most promising ideas.
>		2. Invent improvements for promising ideas.
>		3. Set up a time to evaluate ideas and decide.

>*  Consider brainstorming with the other side. - It comes with increased difficulty and risk but can prove extremely valuable.

### Broaden your options
#### Develop a room within which to negotiate

* Multiply options by shuttling between the specific and the general.
> * The Circle Chart: - four basic steps in inventing options
>   1. Identify the problem - _in the real world_
>   2. Diagnose the problem, sort symptoms into categories, suggest causes, observe what is lacking and note barriers to resolving the problem. - _in theory_
>   3. Design approaches ie broad ideas about what might be done. - _in theory_
>   4. Define possible solutions, ie what might be done and what specific steps and actions to take. - _in the real world_

* Invent agreements of different strengths. - if you cannot agree on substance, perhaps you can agree on the procedure (submit the issue to an arbitrator).
* Change the scope of a proposed agreement. - agreements may be partial and cover only the selected subject matters.

### Look for mutual gain
#### The false assumption of a fixed pie: the less for you, the more for me.
* Identify shared interests.
  * Shared interests lie latent in every negotiation.
  * Shared interests are opportunities, not godsends.
  * Stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable.
* Dovetail different interests.
  * Two children quarreling over an orange.
  * Differences tend to lead towards a solution.
  * Agreement is often based on disagreement.
  * The kinds of differences that best lend themselves to dovetailing are differences in:
    * interests
    * beliefs
    * the value places on time
    * forecasts
    * aversion to risk.
* Ask for their preferences.

### Make their decision easy
#### You want to confront them with a choice that is as painless as possible.

* Whose shoes?
  * You cannot negotiate successfully with an abstraction.
  * Pick one person and try to confront his point of view.
  * By focusing on one person you are not ignoring complexities, but better understanding them.
* What decision?
  * Your task is to give them not a problem but an answer.
  * Give them not a tough decision but an easy one.
* Making threats is not enough.
  * Offers are usually more effective.
  * Write an option in the form of a "_yesable proposition_".


## Insist on Using Objective Criteria

### Deciding on the basis of will is costly
#### Negotiators tend to resolve conflicts by positional bargaining of what they are willing and unwilling to accept

* The solution is to negotiate on some basis _independent_ of the will of either side.

### The case for using objective criteria
#### The approach is to commit yourself to reaching a solution based on principle, not pressure

* Principled negotiation produces wise agreements amicably and efficiently.
  * A constant battle for dominance threatens a relationship; principled negotiation protects it.
  * It reduces the number of commitments that each side must make.

### Developing objective criteria
#### Develop some alternative standards beforehand

* Fair standards - it needs to be independent of each side's will.
* Fair procedures - used for resolving conflicting interests.

### Negotiating with objective criteria
#### Focus on objective criteria firmly but flexibly

* Three basic points to remember
  1. Frame each issue as a joint search for objective criteria
  2. Reason and be open to reason as to which standards are most appropriate and how they should be applied.
  3. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.


## What if they are more powerful?

### Protecting yourself
#### Against an agreement you should reject

* The cost of using a bottom line is high.
* Know your BATNA - Best Alternative to Negotiation Agreement.
* The insecurity of an unknown BATNA.
* Formulate a trip wire - it can limit the authority of a mediator.

### Making most out of your assets
#### The answer lies in BATNA

* The better your BATNA, the greater your power.

  _*"The relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement."*_

* Develop your BATNA.
  1. Invent a list of actions you might take if no agreement is reached
  2. Convert some more promising ideas into practical alternatives
  3. Select tentatively the one alternative that seems best

* Consider the other side's BATNA. 

## What if They Won't Play

### Principled negotiation
#### Focus on what _you_ may do

* The subject of this book.
* Concentrate on the merits, rather than on positions.
* Change the game simply by starting to play a new one.

### Negotiation jujitsu
#### Focus on what _they_ may do

* Don't attack their position, look behind it.
* Don't defend your ideas, invite criticism and advice.
* Ask questions and pause.

### Consider the _one-text_ procedure
#### Introduce a mediator or mediate your own dispute

* Separate inventing from decision making.
* Reduce the number of decisions required to reach an agreement.
* Help the parties know what they will get when they do decide.
* Simply prepare a draft and ask for criticism.

### Getting them to play

* "_Please correct me if I'm wrong_"
* "_We appreciate what you've done for us_"
* "_Our concern is fairness_"
* "_We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not on who can do what to whom_"
* "_This is a separate issue_"
* "_Could I ask you a few questions to see whether my facts are right_"
* "_What's the principle behind your action?_"
* "_Let me see if I understand what you're saying_"
* "_Let me get back to you_"
* "_Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasoning_"
* "_One fair solution might be..._"
* "_If we agree... If we disagree..._"
* "_We'd be happy to see if we can leave when It's most convenient for you_"
* "_It's been a pleasure dealing with you_"

## What If They Use Dirty Tricks?

_Engage in the principled negotiation about the procedure of the negotiating process._

### How do you negotiate about the rules of the game?
#### Three steps:
  1. Recognize the dirty tactic
  2. Raise the issue explicitly
  3. Question the tactic's legitimacy and desirability

* Separate people from the problem.
* Focus on interests, not positions.
* Invent options for mutual gain.
* Insist on using objective criteria.

### Some common dirty tactics

#### Deliberate deception

* Phony facts. - unless you have a good reason to trust somebody, don't.
* Ambiguous authority. - "second bite at the apple"
* Dubious intentions. - build compliance features into the agreement itself.
* Less than full disclosure is not the same as deception. - good faith negotiation does not require total disclosure.

#### Psychological warfare

* Stressful situations. - identify the problem and raise it.
* Personal attack. - recognize the tactic and raise it.
* The good-guy/bad-guy routine. - you won't be taken in.
* Threats. - warnings are much more legitimate.

#### Positional pressure tactics

* Refusal to negotiate. - possible ploy, an attempt to use their entry into negotiation as a bargaining chip to obtain some concession on substance. A variant on this ploy is to set preconditions for negotiations.
* Extreme demands. - with the aim of lowering expectations.
* Escalating demands. - psychological effect of making you want to agree quickly before more demands get raised.
* Lock-in tactics. - like threats they depend on communication.
* Hardhearted partner. - recognize the tactic.
* A calculated delay. - waiting for the right time is a high-cost game.
* "_Take it or leave it._" - it is not negotiation, not a interactive decision-making. Consider ignoring it at first, and later raise up the recognized tactic and let them know what they have to lose.

#### Don't be a victim

* It's often hard to decide what it means to negotiate in "good faith".
* Dealing with a friend or family approach.
* It may be useful to ask about the rules of the negotiation up front.
